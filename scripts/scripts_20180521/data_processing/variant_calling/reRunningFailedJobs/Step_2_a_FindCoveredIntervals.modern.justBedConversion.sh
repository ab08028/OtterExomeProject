########## Notice: this already gives you non-overlapping intervals so you should NOT do bedtools merge

# you'll then use this as -L when you call variants.
# min coverage: 10 (or 5?) -- going down to 1 for now. 
# minimum map quality : 30 (JAR pipeline)
# minimum base quality: 20 (JAR pipeline)
# are these too stringent?

# Also want to make a bed file version
# how to: the interval list has format: 
# GL896898.1:37826-37995 (scaffold:start-stop) and is 1-based.
# So for .bed file, I need to make it 0-based on the start coord and non-inclusive for end coord, so keep the same
# so want scaffold\tstart-1\tstop for bed version (to use for other things)
########## also make a bed version: 
awk -F [:-] '{OFS="\t"; print $1,$2-1,$3}' $outdir/${header}.coveredIntervals.list > $outdir/${header}.coveredIntervals.int.bed
# want to check that nothing got made negative 1 (if it started at 0)
sed -i'' 's/-1/0/g' $outdir/${header}.coveredIntervals.int.bed
# update: 20180730: DO NOT MERGE. Nothing gets merged and it is just slow and sometimes errors out.
#bedtools merge -i $outdir/${header}.coveredIntervals.bed > $outdir/${header}.coveredIntervals.int.bed
# and want to add dots for empty six fields 
awk '{OFS="\t"; print $1,$2,$3,".",".","."}' $outdir/${header}.coveredIntervals.int.bed > $outdir/${header}.coveredIntervals.bed
rm $outdir/${header}.coveredIntervals.int.bed
