after you have gotten your SNP file through the bespoke filters with 20% missingness,
do PCA and FASTRUCTURE and relatedness analyses to determine which individuals 
you want to exclude due to admixture or being related.

So use this snp file: 
'snp_7_maxNoCallFrac_0.2_passingBespoke_passingAllFilters_postMerge_'${infile}
for PCA analysis

but when moving forward with filtering you are going to continue working with the 'all' file:
'all_7_passingBespoke_maxNoCallFrac_0.9_rmBadIndividuals_passingFilters_'${infile}
# because you don't want a stringent missingness filter going into the SFS
