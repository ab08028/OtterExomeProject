Dadi notes

- Forward in time model
- otter questions:
	- pop split times
	- migration rates
	- number of bottlenecks
	
	
- Need L and mutation rate (L will differ across each population)
- make a table of pop names and Ls
- note that "sample" refers to a single chromosome in the manual; so 4 "samples" is from two diploids; so Nref is in terms of haploids I think....




Questions -
Nref is in haploids?
samples = haploids?
