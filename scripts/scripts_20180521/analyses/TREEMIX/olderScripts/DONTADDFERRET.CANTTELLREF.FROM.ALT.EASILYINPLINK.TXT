used to try to add ferret as an outgroup
but A1 and A2 in plink (even with keep-allele-order)
don't correspond to ref/alt or alt/ref
it's all major minor

have to tangle with a2allele setting, but that requires refIDs to be in the vcf, etc. lots of formatting

too much hassle

Especially since the ferret outgroup squishes the rest of the tree too much

Just have CA be the root -- it is the most separated. Try with different roots to make sure
