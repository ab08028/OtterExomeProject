tanya's scripts don't use chr designations so they collapse regions -- affects both pi and total snps!

for example:
kuril islands has 232,476 neutral regions 
but in pi script there are only 232,274
this is the total unique entries if you remove chr designations! so it's collapsing some.

this is an issue that must be fixed
