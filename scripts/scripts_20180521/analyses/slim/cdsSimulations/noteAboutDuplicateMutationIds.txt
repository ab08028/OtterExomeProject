there may be duplicate mut ids BETWEEN chunks, but you need to condition on the chunk number and MUT id
think of it like chr and position. There may be duplicate positions between two choromosomes, but not a chr2:3000 and chr2:3000 in the dataset. This is OKAY. 

So if you see duplicate mutation ids in a file, don't freak out UNLESS they also have the same chunk id.
Then something would be wrong.
But if you just see duplicate mutation IDs and they are from different chunks you are fine
