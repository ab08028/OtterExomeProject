# something like
# okay so my submitter/array situation isn't too crazy
# just have to revise it a bit

# where 25 is number of reps I want 
for i in {1..25}
do
qsub slim.submitter.sh $i # where slim.submitter array file (maybe use my array file?) sets 14 chunks going with internal sge task id
done


# then within slim submitter it does something like:
-t 1-14
rep=$1 # gets from loop
chunk=$SGE_TASK_ID
$slim script.slim -d "v_REP=$rep" -d "v_CHUNK=$chunk" slimscript.slim 


# my array file basically already does this

# so just make my array work with the new files ! i think i mostly have it set up
# try to minimize changes that need to be made to files

# need to make a different make-slim file for each otter population (note that COM should be 3epoch)
