Model parameters for sea otter simulations:

dominance coefficients: 0 (recessive); 0.5 (additive)
mutation rate: 8.64e-9
(generation time: 6-7 years/gen)

Alaska:
Nanc = 4500 diploids
Ncur = 250 diploids
Time of contraction = 35 gen ago
number of individuals to sample in VCF for SFS: 7 (sample VCF after burnin and after contraction)
optional: could add recovery to ~2500 individuals or so (10,000 census size) for 5-10 generations


California:
Nanc = 3500 generations
Ncur = 135 diploids
Time of contraction = 35 gen ago
number of individuals to sample in VCF for SFS: 6 (sample VCF after burnin and after contraction)
optional: could add recovery to ~1000 individuals or so (3000 census size) for 5-10 generations


Split time between populations: ~8000 generations
((optional) could add migration)

Note: could make contraction more recent/extreme or older/milder for each population depending on what we want to test
