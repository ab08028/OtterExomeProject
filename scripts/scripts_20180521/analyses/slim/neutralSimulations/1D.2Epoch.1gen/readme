the basic slim model is in : generic.2Epoch.100kb.10genContraction.20180125.slim
 this has a burnin period of 50,000 generations and a contracton time of 10generations. You must change 
these values within the script if you want to change them (going to work on a better approach to this)


slim.2Epoch.array.sh will let you set values for the rest of the parameters (mu, r, Nanc, etc.) and submit an array of 60 tasks
each of which simulates 100x1kb independent blocks, for a total of 6000x1kb blocks


slim.2Epoch.submitter.sh will let you submit 100 (or more) replicates of the array jobs. 



So if you wanted to do 100 replicates of the array, you would just sh slim.2Epoch.submitter.sh and then it would submit 100 array jobs (each with 60 chunks) for you based on the generic.2Epoch.100kb.10genContraction.20180125.slim model

To modify parameters, you change them in slim.2Epoch.array.sh script, unless it is adjusting the burnin or time of contraction, which must be modified in the script body itself (for now)
